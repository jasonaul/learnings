What is Javascript? A brief high-level primer:
 * JavaScript is a high-level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
    ** High-level = we don't have to worry about complex things such as memory management
    ** Object-oriented = Based on objects for storing most kinds of data
    ** Multi-paradigm = it is so flexible and versityle, we can use different styles of programming.

The Role of JavaScript in Web Development
* Works in conjunction with HTML (content of the page), CSS (the styling/presentation of content), and JavaScript (the real programming language of t he internet that allows you to manipulate content, build applications, construct dynamic pages, etc.)
* Think of it like this. HTML = nouns, CSS = adjectives, and JS = verbs (the actionable items)

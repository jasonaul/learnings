<br> - Line break (just a line space)

<button>

<canvas>

<center> - You almost certainly woun't use this, since CSS will handle it for you, but it centers whatever is between the tags.

<div>

<em> - Adds emphasis, as in italicized. Use this over <i>

<embed>

<footer>

<form>

<head>

<header>

<h1> to <h6> - Heading text of varying size, h1 largest, h6 smallest
